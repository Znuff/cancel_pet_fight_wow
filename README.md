Prompts about canceling the current pet battle/duel if no rare pet is found on the opposing team. Useful when trying to catch only rare (blue) pets.

There are no settings. Simply start a pet battle. If there are no rare pets in the opposing team, there will be a prompt asking you to continue or cancel the fight. Simply pressing "Escape" on your keyboard, or "Cancel" in the dialogue menu will cancel the pet battle.

Unfortunately the "Cancel" function requires a hardware event and can't be automatically fired.

### Commands

- /cpf **chat** - toggles printing the current opposing team to chat
- /cpf **popup** - toggles between the old mode (displaying a pop-up) or the new overlay mode (new overlay mode is by default)
- /cpf **mark** - toggle the raid marking option
- Shift+Clicking the Forfeit button on the PetBattle UI will immediately cancel the battle without any confirmation!
